#  What are the 7 essentials a new computer should have?

There are many things to consider when purchasing a new computer. But what are the most important features? Here are seven essentials that every new computer should have:

1.  Processor: The processor is the heart of the computer. It performs all the calculations and coordinates all the other components. Processors are classified by their performance, measured in gigahertz (GHz). The higher the GHz number, the faster the processor.

2.  RAM: Random Access Memory, or RAM, is used to store data and programs that are currently in use. The more RAM a computer has, the better it will perform. For best results, get a computer with at least 4GB of RAM.

3.  Graphics card: A graphics card is responsible for displaying images on the screen. Look for a card with good 3D gaming capabilities if you plan on using your computer for gaming.

4. Hard drive: The hard drive is where all your data is stored. Itâ€™s important to get a drive that has plenty of storage space, especially if you plan on storing music or videos on your computer. For most people, a 500GB drive should be adequate.

5. Operating system: The operating system is the software that controls everything that happens on your computer. The most popular choice these days is Windows 10, but there are also many good Linux distributions available as well.

6. Screen: A good screen should have high resolution and a wide viewing angle so you can see it clearly from any angle.

7. Keyboard and mouse: Be sure to get a good quality keyboard and mouse to make using your computer more comfortable and efficient

#  What are the benefits of each essential?

Here is a look at some of the key benefits of each essential oil:

Lavender oil: Lavender is known for its calming effects, which can help reduce stress and anxiety. It's also been shown to improve sleep quality and promote relaxation.

Peppermint oil: Peppermint oil has a refreshing aroma that can help boost energy levels and improve focus. It's also been shown to be effective in relieving digestive problems and headaches.

Eucalyptus oil: Eucalyptus oil is known for its healing properties, which can help relieve respiratory problems, muscle pain, and inflammation. It also has a cooling effect that can be helpful in the summer months.

Frankincense oil: Frankincense is known for its anti-aging properties, which can help keep skin looking healthy and youthful. It's also been shown to be effective in treating anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders.

#  How can you be sure your new computer has all the essentials?

When it comes time to buy a new computer, there are some important things you need to remember. For example, what software is already installed on the computer and what do you need to buy? Do you have all the necessary cords and adapters?

Here is a checklist of essential things to consider when buying a new computer:

-Operating system: What type of operating system does the computer come with? If you're not familiar with computers or don't want to spend time learning a new one, you may want to get a computer that already has the operating system you're comfortable using.

-Adapter plugs: Make sure your computer has all of the appropriate adapter plugs, including an HDMI port if you plan to use a monitor or television.

-Antivirus software: Many computers come with some type of antivirus software pre-installed, but it's always a good idea to check. If your computer doesn't come with antivirus protection, you'll want to purchase it before using the computer online.

-Microsoft Office: Most new computers come with a trial version of Microsoft Office pre-installed. This is great for basic needs, but if you need more features or want to use the software on multiple devices, you'll need to purchase a license.

-Browser: The most popular browsers are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Make sure the computer you're buying has one of these browsers pre-installed.

Other things to consider include the amount of built-in storage space and whether or not the computer has a built-in webcam. Be sure to ask any questions before making your purchase so you can be sure the new computer has everything you need!

#  Is there a difference between essential features for a desktop computer and laptop computer?

The essential features for a desktop computer and laptop computer are mostly the same. A desktop computer needs a good processor, plenty of memory, a large hard drive, a good video card and a monitor. A laptop needs all of those things, plus a battery and a reliable way to connect to the Internet.

There are some differences between desktop and laptop computers. Laptops are smaller and lighter, making them easier to take with you on the go. Laptops also tend to have better battery life than desktops. Desktop computers usually have more ports and slots than laptops, making them better for connecting devices like printers or scanners.

Overall, the essential features for a desktop or laptop computer are largely the same. The main difference is that laptops are portable while desktops usually stay in one place.

#  Do you need to purchase all the essentials separately, or are they included in some computers?

Most computers include all of the essential peripherals that you will need. The only things you might need to purchase separately are a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
